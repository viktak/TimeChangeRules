# TimeChangeRules
TimeChangeRules for TimeZones

This library complements the [Arduino Timezone Library](https://github.com/JChristensen/Timezone) by Jack Christensen.

It provides Time change rule definitions for several time zones. I only added a few to get started, but haven't finished as it takes a lot of time to do all of them correctly.

Feel free to add any missing ones and submit a pull request.

Usage is described [here](https://github.com/JChristensen/Timezone#coding-timechangerules).
